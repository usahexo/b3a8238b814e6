#  Jaguars to Sport All-Black Unis in Week 1

The Jacksonville Jaguars will sport all-black uniforms for their Week 1 matchup against the Houston Texans, according to a report from ESPN's Adam Schefter.

This won't be the first time the Jaguars have worn all-black uniforms; they last donned the look in a Week 11 game against the Arizona Cardinals in 2013.

While it's not clear why the Jaguars are wearing all-black unis, it will certainly make them stand out on the field. And with their new helmets and cleats, they'll definitely look intimidating.

Whether or not this will give them an edge over the Texans remains to be seen, but it'll definitely be an interesting game to watch.

#  Jaguars Kickoff 2017 Season With Color Rush Game

The Jacksonville Jaguars will kickoff their 2017 regular season on September 10th, with a “color rush” game against the Houston Texans. This will be the first time that the Jaguars have worn their color rush uniforms, which are all-purple with gold accents.

The Jaguars’ color rush uniforms are a throwback to their original uniforms, which they wore from 1995-2011. The team has not worn these uniforms since they changed to their current black and teal color scheme in 2012.

The Jaguars’ players seem to be excited about the new uniforms. Defensive end Calais Campbell said, “I love it. It’s different; it sticks out. It let’s people know we’re a different team and we’re coming to play. We want to be known as a tough football team that comes to play every Sunday and has no fear. That’s what this uniform stands for.”

The color rush game against the Texans is just the beginning of a busy preseason for the Jaguars. They will also host the New England Patriots on August 10th and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on August 24th. The Jaguars will then head to Miami to face the Dolphins in their preseason opener on August 17th.

#  Jaguars Will Wear Black Jerseys and Pants on Thursday

The Jacksonville Jaguars announced that they will be wearing black jerseys and pants for their Thursday night game against the Tennessee Titans.

"We wanted to do something special for our fans and wear black on Thursday night," said Jaguars Owner Shad Khan. "I know they will enjoy seeing the team in these unique uniforms."

This will be the first time that the Jaguars have worn black jerseys and pants in a game.

#  Jaguars to Wear All Black uniforms vs Titans

The Jaguars announced that they will be wearing their all black uniforms for their Week 3 game against the Titans.

This will be the first time that the Jaguars have worn black uniforms since their home playoff game against the Steelers in January of 2018.

“We are excited to wear our all black uniforms and bring some intimidation to our opponents,” said Jaguars Executive Vice President of Football Operations Tom Coughlin.

The Jaguars are 1-1 this season and are looking to pick up their first victory of the year in Week 3.

#  Jaguars players, coaches to wear all black against Titans

 Jaguars players and coaches will don all black uniforms for their Week 10 matchup against the Titans, according to a team source.

"It's a respect thing," the source said. "We're going to show some love to the old-school fans who have been rocking with us since Day One."

The Jaguars (3-5) enter Sunday's game as underdogs against the Titans (4-4), but they'll look to make a statement in their black uniforms.

"I'm excited about it," defensive tackle Malik Jackson said Wednesday. "I know the other team is going to be in all white, so it'll be fun to look out there and see all black."

 kicks off at 1 p.m. ET on Sunday and will be streamed live on .
