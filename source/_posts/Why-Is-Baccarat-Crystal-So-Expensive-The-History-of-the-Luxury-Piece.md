#  Why Is Baccarat Crystal So Expensive? The History of the Luxury Piece

As with any luxury good, there is always a reason why prices are so high. In the case of Baccarat crystal, there is a long and interesting history that helps explain why it is considered such an extravagant item.

Baccarat was first introduced in the 15th century as a card game. It wasn’t until the 18th century that people began to create crystal pieces inspired by the game. From there, Baccarat became a popular choice for luxury gifts among the wealthy and elite.

One of the reasons why Baccarat crystal is so expensive is because it takes a great deal of time and skill to make. The process involves crafting each piece by hand and then delicately etching designs into it. This requires a great deal of time and care, which drives up the cost.

Another reason for Baccarat’s high price tag is its association with luxury brands. Many upscale retailers only carry Baccarat crystal, helping to drive up costs even further.

Overall, there are many factors that contribute to the high price of Baccarat crystal. Its history as a prestigious card game, its intricate construction process, and its status as a luxury brand all play a role in making this type of crystal one of the most expensive in the world.

#  How Baccarat Crystal Became an Icon of Luxury 

The history of Baccarat Crystal is one intertwining with luxury and sophistication. The name “Baccarat” comes from an Italian word meaning “zero”, a nod to the game of chance that the company’s founders first manufactured crystal gaming sets for. It all started in 1765, when King Louis XV commissioned Pierre Javelle to create a new type of lead crystal. This led to the founding of two very different crystal companies: Baccarat in France and Swarovski in Austria. 

Baccarat has always been seen as the crème de la crème of crystal manufacturers, with their products often associated with wealth and luxury. Some of their earliest clients were European royals, who appreciated the fine craftsmanship and unique designs that Baccarat is known for. Celebrities and affluent consumers have also been drawn to Baccarat over the years, making it one of the most recognizable brands in the luxury market. 

What is it about Baccarat Crystal that sets it apart from other luxury brands? There are several factors at play: its history, craftsmanship, and exclusivity. Baccarat has been around for centuries, and its reputation as a leading maker of high-quality crystal is well-known. The company employs some of the best craftsmen in the industry, who take pride in their workmanship. And because Baccarat is not as well-known as other luxury brands, it has a certain air of exclusivity that appeals to those looking for something special.
