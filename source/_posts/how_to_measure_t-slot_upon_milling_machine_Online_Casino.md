# How to Measure T-Slot on Milling Machine

T-slots are important components of milling machines that allow for the attachment of fixtures and other workholding devices. To properly attach these fixtures, it is important to know the dimensions of the T-slot. In this article, we will discuss how to measure T-slot on a milling machine.

## Step 1: Gather the Necessary Tools

To measure the T-slot on a milling machine, you will need the following tools:

- Dial calipers
- Micrometer
- Depth gauge
- Square

## Step 2: Clean the T-Slot

Before measuring the T-slot, it is important to clean it thoroughly to remove any debris or dirt that may affect the accuracy of your measurements.

## Step 3: Measure the Width

The first dimension to measure is the width of the T-slot. To do this, place the square against the inside of the T-slot and use the dial calipers to measure the distance between the two sides of the T-slot. This measurement should be taken at the top and bottom of the T-slot to ensure accuracy.

## Step 4: Measure the Depth

The next dimension to measure is the depth of the T-slot. This is measured from the top of the T-slot to the bottom. To do this, use the depth gauge to measure the distance from the top of the T-slot to the milling machine table.

## Step 5: Measure the Length

Finally, measure the length of the T-slot. This is done by using the micrometer to measure the distance between the two ends of the T-slot.

## Step 6: Record the Measurements

Once you have measured all three dimensions of the T-slot, record them for future reference. This will help ensure that any fixtures or workholding devices you attach to the T-slot will fit properly.

## Conclusion

Measuring the T-slot on a milling machine is an important step in properly attaching fixtures and workholding devices. By following the steps outlined in this article and using the necessary tools, you can ensure that your measurements are accurate and that any attachments you add to the T-slot will fit properly.
