#  Gambling and Bob's Burgers? A match made in heaven!

If you're a fan of the TV show Bob's Burgers, there's no doubt you've noticed all of the hilarious gambling references throughout the series. From Louise's illegal casino in her treehouse to Bob's botched attempt at playing blackjack in order to win back his restaurant, gambling is a recurring theme on the show. So why is gambling such a big part of Bob's Burgers?

As it turns out, the show's creators are themselves big fans of gambling, and they've used the show as a way to work in some of their own personal experiences with gambling. In an interview with Vulture, creator Loren Bouchard explained, "Gambling is something that we're all interested in and attracted to, because there's so much at stake. It's life and death in a sense."

And it's not just the creators who are into gambling â€“ many of the show's cast and crew are too. In fact, actor Jon Hamm even has a bit of a gambling addiction and was forced to seek treatment for it several years ago.

So why is Bob's Burgers so obsessed with gambling? According to Bouchard, it's because "gambling is about making calculated risks, and that feels very Bob's Burgers to us." And we can't help but agree! The characters on Bob's Burgers are always taking risks, and the gambles they take always lead to some hilarious moments.

Whether you're a fan of gambling or not, there's no denying that Bob's Burgers has some of the funniest references to it out there. If you want to see for yourself, be sure to check out some of the best ones below!
