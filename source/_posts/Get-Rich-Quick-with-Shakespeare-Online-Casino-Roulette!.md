#  How Does Roulette Work at Shakespeare Casino?

Roulette is one of the most popular casino games and at Shakespeare Casino, it's one of the easiest games to understand and play. In this article, we're going to take a look at how roulette works, what different bets you can place and how to win at roulette.

## The Basics of Roulette

Roulette is a type of casino game where players bet on where a ball will land after spinning around a wheel. There are different types of bets that you can make in roulette, including betting on a single number, betting on a range of numbers or betting on whether the ball will land in black or red.

The aim of the game is to correctly predict where the ball will end up after the spin. If you guess correctly, you'll win your bet amount multiplied by the odds for that bet. For example, if you bet on a single number and the ball lands on that number, you'll win 36 times your original bet amount. However, if you guess incorrectly, you'll lose your bet amount.

At Shakespeare Casino, we offer both American and European versions of roulette. The difference between the two versions is that American roulette has two zeroes (0 and 00), while European roulette only has one zero (0). This makes European roulette more favourable to players as there is a higher chance of winning when betting on single numbers.

## How to Play Roulette

To play roulette, first choose how much money you want to wager on each spin. You can then place your bets by clicking on the relevant boxes on the table layout. When you're ready, click 'Spin' to start the game. The dealer then spins the wheel and releases the ball, which begins its journey around the wheel before finally landing in one of the numbered slots. If you've placed a winning bet, your payout is automatically calculated and paid out to you. If you've lost any bets during the spin, they are automatically collected from your account balance.

There are different ways that you can place bets in roulette - we'll take a look at some of them below:

### Inside Bets: These are bets that are placed on specific numbers or combinations of numbers within the table layout. The odds for inside bets are higher as there is less chance of winning but also offer bigger payouts if successful. Some common inside bets include:

  * Betting on a single number - pays out 36-1
* Betting on two numbers together - pays out 17-1
* Betting on three numbers together - pays out 11-1
* Betting on four numbers together - pays out 8-1
