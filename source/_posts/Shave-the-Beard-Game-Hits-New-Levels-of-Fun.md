#  Shave the Beard Game Hits New Levels of Fun

If you're like most men, you probably enjoy a good game of shaving. No, not the morning kind where you hurry to get ready for work – but the playful kind where you can take your time and really master the art.

For some guys, this means growing a beard. But what do you do when it's time to shave the beard?

There are all sorts of ways to have fun with it. You can try different shaving techniques, experiment with different kinds of razors, or just take your time and enjoy the experience.

Some guys prefer to shave their beards while they're still wet, while others like to wait until they're completely dry. Some use a straight razor while others prefer electric razors.

No matter how you do it, shaving a beard can be a lot of fun. You can make it as simple or as complex as you want. You can take your time and enjoy the experience or race through it and see who can finish first.

Shaving a beard is also a great way to test your skills. Can you shave it perfectly in one pass? Or do you need to go over it multiple times? How smoothly can you shave without getting any nicks or cuts?

The possibilities are endless. So grab a razor and get started!

#  No More Beards at the LSletan Casino – Time to Shave!

It’s been a few months now since the news of the new no-beard policy at LSletan Casino spread around the internet. The initial reaction to the news was mostly disbelief with a little bit of outrage thrown in for good measure. 

However, as more and more people have had a chance to see the new policy in action, it’s become clear that this is actually a great change for the casino. Shaving is becoming more and more popular these days, and there’s no reason why LSletan Casino can’t capitalize on that trend. 

There are some who argue that beards make people look more approachable or trustworthy. However, studies have actually shown that beards are often associated with negative traits like untrustworthiness and uncleanliness. In fact, one study found that beards can reduce trust by up to 50%. 

That’s not to say that everyone views beards negatively – there are plenty of people who love beards and think they look great. But the bottom line is that LSletan Casino is trying to appeal to as many people as possible, and that means getting rid of the bearded guys. 

Shaving isn’t just about appearances though. It’s also about hygiene. Beards can trap all sorts of bacteria and dirt, which can lead to skin problems like acne and folliculitis. So not only do beards look bad, they can also make you sick. 

There’s no doubt that shaving can be a little bit inconvenient, but it’s worth it for the benefits it provides. LSletan Casino has made the right decision in implementing this new policy, and I hope other casinos follow their lead.
