#  Champions League Final: Real Madrid vs Juventus - Who do you think will win?

Saturday, 3 June will see the biggest match in Europe as Real Madrid take on Juventus in the Champions League final. The match has all the ingredients to be a classic, with two of the most successful clubs in Europe going head-to-head for European football’s biggest prize.

Real Madrid come into the final as favourites having won the competition twice in the last three years. However, Juventus have proved they are a force to be reckoned with this season, knocking out Barcelona and Monaco en route to the final.

Despite being underdogs, Juventus will be confident of causing an upset against Madrid. The Italian side have one of the best defences in Europe, having conceded only three goals in their 12 Champions League games this season. In addition, they have a number of attacking options who can cause problems for Madrid’s defence, including Gonzalo Higuain and Paulo Dybala.

Real Madrid, meanwhile, have been scoring goals for fun this season. They have scored 36 goals in their 12 Champions League games, with Cristiano Ronaldo leading the charge with 15 goals. Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema have also been in good form, meaning Juve’s defence will have their work cut out if they are to keep Real at bay.

So who do you think will win on Saturday? Will Juventus cause an upset and become European champions for the first time since 1996? Or will Real Madrid continue their dominance of European football and lift their third Champions League trophy in four years? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below!

#  Mayweather vs McGreggor Fight: How to bet on the megafight

The long awaited fight between Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor is finally upon us. The two fighters have been trading barbs back and forth for months, and the trash talk has only intensified as the fight gets closer.

Mayweather is a heavy favorite going into the fight, but that doesn't mean there aren't opportunities to make some money on McGregor. Here are a few ways to bet on the megafight:

Moneyline bets
Mayweather is a big favorite in this fight, so you'll get very low payouts if you bet on him. McGregor, on the other hand, is a significant underdog, so your payout will be much higher if he pulls off the upset.

Point spread bets
The point spread for this fight is currently set at -8.5 for Mayweather. This means that Mayweather is expected to win by 8.5 points or more. If you think McGregor can pull off the upset, you can bet on him +8.5 points.

Over/under bets
The over/under for this fight is currently set at 9.5 rounds. If you think the fight will last fewer than 9 rounds, you would bet under; if you think it will go more than 9 rounds, you would bet over.

#  US Open Predictions: Will Nadal make it to the final again?

Last year's US Open was a huge upset for the tennis world. Rafael Nadal, who was the favorite to win the tournament, was knocked out in the semifinal round by Juan Martin del Potro. This year, many people are wondering if Nadal will be able to make it to the final again.

Nadal is currently ranked number two in the world, and he has been playing extremely well lately. He won the French Open this year, and he also won the Rogers Cup a few weeks ago. However, Nadal has struggled at times in recent tournaments. He lost in the semifinals of Wimbledon this year, and he also lost in the quarters of the Australian Open earlier this year.

Many people believe that Nadal will make it to the final again this year, but they are not sure if he will be able to win. His biggest competition is likely to come from Roger Federer or Novak Djokovic, both of whom are ranked number one and two in the world respectively. Federer has been playing very well lately and is considered to be one of the favorites to win the tournament. Djokovic has had some ups and downs this year, but he is still considered to be a major threat.

It will definitely be interesting to see what happens at this year's US Open. If Nadal can play like he usually does, then he has a good chance of winning it all. However, there are many other talented players who could potentially beat him. In any case, it should be an exciting tournament!

#  Premier League Season Preview: Top contenders and dark horses

As the Premier League prepares to kickoff, there are many teams with high expectations. Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Tottenham and Arsenal are all considered title contenders. But there are also a few dark horses who could make a surprise run at the title.

Manchester United had a disappointing season last year and finished in 6th place. However, they have made some big signings this summer and are expected to be one of the top teams this year. Paul Pogba was the most expensive player in history when he was transferred from Juventus for £89 million. He will be joined by world-class players like Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Henrikh Mkhitaryan. Other new signings include Eric Bailly, Marcus Rashford and Mogan Schneiderlin.

 Manchester City had a very successful season last year, finishing in 3rd place behind Chelsea and Tottenham. This year they will be looking to win the Premier League for the first time ever. They have made some big signings this summer, including John Stones from Everton for £47.5 million and Leroy Sane from Schalke for £37 million. They also managed to keep hold of their star players like Kevin De Bruyne, David Silva and Sergio Aguero.

Liverpool had an excellent season last year, finishing in 4th place behind eventual champions Leicester City. This year they will be looking to go one step further and win the Premier League. They have made some good signings this summer, including Sadio Mane from Southampton for £34 million and Georginio Wijnaldum from Newcastle United for £25 million. However, they have also lost some key players, including captain Jordan Henderson and striker Christian Benteke.

Tottenham had an extremely successful season last year, finishing in 2nd place behind only champions Leicester City. This year they will be looking to go one step further and win the Premier League themselves. They have made some good signings this summer, including Victor Wanyama from Southampton for £11 million and Vincent Janssen from AZ Alkmaar for £17 million. However, they have also lost some key players, including midfield stalwart Mousa Dembele and striker Harry Kane’s backup Emmanuel Adebayor.

Chelsea had a mediocre season last year by their high standards, finishing in 10th place after winning the Premier League in 2014-15 and getting to the Champions League semi-finals in 2015-16. This year they will be looking to get back to their winning ways. They have made some big signings this summer, including Michy Batshuayi from Marseille for £33 million and N’Golo Kante from Leicester City for £32 million). They have also managed to keep hold of their star players like Eden Hazard and Diego Costa
