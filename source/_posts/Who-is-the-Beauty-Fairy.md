#  What inspired Shakespeare to write his play, The beauty fairy?

Scholars have long debated what inspired Shakespeare to write his play, The beauty fairy. Some say that he drew inspiration from contemporary works such as Greene's Groatsworth of Wit and Christopher Marlowe's Doctor Faustus. However, many believe that the true source of Shakespeare's inspiration was the legend of Tam Lin.

According to the legend, Tam Lin was a handsome young man who was kidnapped by the fairies. He was kept in their forest kingdom for many years until one day he was able to escape and return to his human friends. Some say that the fairies wanted to keep him for himself, while others believe that they were trying to protect him from an evil force that was after him.

Many people believe that the story of Tam Lin is what inspired Shakespeare to write his play, The beauty fairy. In the play, Puck is tasked with finding a maiden who is willing to kiss the fairies king. When Puck finds Titania, she is proudly wearing a crown of daisies and looking very happy. This suggests that Titania may be the maiden who was willing to kiss the king and free Tam Lin from the fairies.
