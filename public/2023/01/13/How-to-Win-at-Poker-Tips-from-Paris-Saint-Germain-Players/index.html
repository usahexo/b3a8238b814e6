With their extravagant spending habits and array of stars, they dominate not just their home leagues but also Europe-wide tournaments. One such team is Paris Saint-Germain, who have accumulated trophies galore since their inception in 1970.</p>
<p>The team’s recent successes can be put down to a number of factors. One is their excellent scouting network, which has led them to signing some of the best players in the world. Another is head coach Unai Emery, who has instilled a winning mentality in the squad and developed them into a well-oiled machine.</p>
<p>But one other key factor is the poker skills of many of the PSG players. Poker is a game that requires mental toughness, strategic thinking and discipline, all skills which can be utilised on the football pitch. In this article, we will take a look at some of the PSG players who are deadly in both poker and football.</p>
<ol>
<li>Neymar Jr</li>
</ol>
<p>Neymar is easily one of the best footballers in the world right now, and his exploits for both club and country have made him one of the most sought-after players on the planet. He joined PSG from Barcelona last year for a world-record fee of £198 million, and he has since shown exactly why he was so coveted.</p>
<p>He is not only an incredible goalscorer but also an outstanding playmaker, as evidenced by his 21 assists in all competitions this season. Neymar’s brilliance has not gone unnoticed in the poker world either; he won €1 million at a charity tournament last year and is considered one of the best poker players in Brazil.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Kylian Mbappé</li>
</ol>
<p>Kylian Mbappé may only be 19 years old, but he has already established himself as one of the top young players in world football. He burst onto the scene at Monaco two years ago with some scintillating performances - including scoring against Manchester City in the Champions League - and his form earned him a move to PSG last summer.</p>
<p>Mbappé had already proven his prowess at poker before arriving at PSG; he won €107,000 at a tournament in Monte Carlo when he was just 17 years old. With his blistering pace, clinical finishing and all-round skill set, Mbappé looks primed to become one of the greatest footballers ever.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Edinson Cavani</li>
</ol>
<p>Edinson Cavani has been with PSG since 2013 and has firmly established himself as one of their key players over that time period. He was initially signed as backup to Zlatan Ibrahimovic but soon became first choice up front due to his goalscoring exploits - he currently has 178 goals for PSG across all competitions, making him their all-time top scorer. Cavani is also an accomplished poker player; he famously won $2 million (£1.5 million) at a high roller tournament in Las Vegas back in 2016.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Marco Verratti<br>One player who often goes understated but is absolutely crucial to PSG’s success is Marco Verratti. The Italian midfielder likes to keep things simple yet is effective with his passing ability and positional awareness; he completes more than 90% of his passes per match on average. As well as being one of Europe’s top midfielders, Verratti is also an accomplished poker player; he has won several tournaments throughout his career including one for €200,000 (£174,000).</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="How-PSG’s-Poker-Stars-are-Winning-Big"><a href="#How-PSG’s-Poker-Stars-are-Winning-Big" class="headerlink" title="How PSG’s Poker Stars are Winning Big"></a>How PSG’s Poker Stars are Winning Big</h1><p>Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) is a professional association football club based in Paris, France. The club was founded in 1970 and currently play in the Ligue 1, the highest tier of French football. PSG are also one of only six clubs to have ever won the UEFA Champions League.</p>
<p>The team is owned by Qatari Sports Investments (QSI), a sovereign wealth fund chaired by Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. The investment has seen large sums of money injected into the team, allowing them to sign some of the biggest players in the world.</p>
<p>In 2017, PSG became the first club ever to break the €200 million barrier in a single season thanks to the arrivals of Neymar and Kylian Mbappé. This summer they smashed that record again with the signings of Italian striker Mauro Icardi and Portuguese midfielder João Félix.</p>
<p>So how have they achieved such sustained success on the pitch? One major reason is their affiliation with Poker Stars, one of the world’s leading online poker platforms.</p>
<p>PokerStars has sponsored PSG since 2014 and since then they have enjoyed exclusive access to some of the best poker players in the world. This has allowed them to learn from some of the game’s greatest minds and develop new strategies which have helped them win big both domestically and internationally.</p>
<p>One key element that Poker Stars has taught PSG is how to manage their finances effectively. By making shrewd investments in new talent, they have been able to keep pace with Europe’s biggest clubs without breaking the bank.</p>
<p>This approach was evident at this year’s transfer window where they secured Icardi for €75 million and Félix for €130 million, two players who were coveted by many other teams across Europe. These deals show that PSG are still a force to be reckoned with even after losing Neymar last season.</p>
<p>QSI also understands that it’s not just about spending big money on top players - it’s also important to create a strong team culture and provide fans with an exciting product on the pitch. This was evident during their title winning campaign last season where they thrilled fans with their free flowing attacking football.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how PSG cope without Neymar this season but with a talented squad and powerful owners, there’s no reason why they can’t continue their success in Ligue 1 and beyond.</p>

<h1 id="From-Neymar-Jr-to-Cavani-The-Ultimate-Guide-to-PSG-Poker"><a href="#From-Neymar-Jr-to-Cavani-The-Ultimate-Guide-to-PSG-Poker" class="headerlink" title="From Neymar Jr to Cavani: The Ultimate Guide to PSG Poker"></a>From Neymar Jr to Cavani: The Ultimate Guide to PSG Poker</h1><p>Paris Saint-Germain is one of the most successful clubs in European football. The French side has won nine league titles and reached the semifinals of the Champions League six times.</p>
<p>The club’s recent success, though, is largely due to investment from Qatar Sports Investments (QSI). QSI has been the owner of PSG since 2011 and has invested over €1.5 billion in the club.</p>
<p>In order to recoup some of that investment, QSI has put together a very strong team. The team is built around Neymar Jr, who was signed from Barcelona in a world-record €222 million deal in 2017.</p>
<p>Neymar Jr is supported by some of Europe’s best players, including Edinson Cavani, Kylian Mbappé, and Angel Di Maria. This guide will take a look at how PSG’s poker hand has evolved since Neymar Jr’s arrival.</p>
<h1 id="Formation-Matters"><a href="#Formation-Matters" class="headerlink" title="Formation Matters"></a>Formation Matters</h1><p>PSG have generally played in a 4-3-3 formation under Thomas Tuchel, but they also used a 4-4-2 diamond formation in their 5-0 win over Monaco in January 2019. This flexibility gives Tuchel multiple options when it comes to setting up his team. He can either use an attacking formation with three forwards or he can use a more defensive formation with two wingers and one central midfielder.</p>

He drifts inside often and likes to shoot from long range. He also likes to dribble past defenders and create chances for his teammates.

He drifts inside often and likes to shoot from long range. He also likes to dribble past defenders and create chances for his teammates. In total, Neymar Jr has scored 85 goals for PSG in 154 appearances.</h1><p>Edinson Cavani plays as the right forward and he is more of a traditional striker than Neymar Jr. Cavani likes to score goals by positioning himself in the middle of the goal mouth and he usually gets most of his chances from crosses into the box. Cavani has scored 156 goals for PSG in 259 appearances, making him PSG’s all-time leading scorer.</p>
<p>Kylian Mbappé plays as a central striker and he is one of the most dangerous players in world football. Mbappé is very fast and he likes to dribble past defenders before shooting or passing to his teammates. He also likes to score goals with his head and he already has 27 goals for PSG in just 58 appearances.</p>
<p>Angel Di Maria plays as a left winger and he provides width for PSG’s attacks. Di Maria isn’t as fast as Mbappé but he is very skilful on the ball and he often scores goals by cutting inside from the left flank onto his right foot. Di Maria has scored 47 goals for PSG in 158 appearances.</p>

<h1 id="1-Know-the-Game"><a href="#1-Know-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="1: Know the Game"></a>1: Know the Game</h1><p>Before sitting down at the table, take some time to learn the basics of the game you’re playing.

There’s no need to become an expert, but understanding the different betting rounds and what each player is trying to achieve will help you play better.</p>
<h1 id="2-Watch-the-Other-Players"><a href="#2-Watch-the-Other-Players" class="headerlink" title="2: Watch the Other Players"></a>2: Watch the Other Players</h1><p>One of the best ways to learn how to play better poker is by watching your opponents.

Don’t be in a rush to make a move – wait for good opportunities.
