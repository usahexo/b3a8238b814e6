	  <h1 id="Anthony-Davis-Nets-300th-Career-Win"><a href="#Anthony-Davis-Nets-300th-Career-Win" class="headerlink" title="Anthony Davis Nets 300th Career Win"></a>Anthony Davis Nets 300th Career Win</h1><p>Anthony Davis has reached another milestone in his career, notching his 300th victory as a professional player. The superstar big man led the New Orleans Pelicans to a 116-104 road win over the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday night.</p>
<p>Davis poured in a game-high 33 points to go along with 12 rebounds and four assists, helping the Pelicans snap a three-game losing streak. The 25-year-old is the fastest player in NBA history to reach 300 wins, doing so in just 497 games.</p>
<p>“That’s a lot of wins,” Davis said after the game. “I’ve been blessed to play with some great teammates and coaches who have helped me get to this point.”</p>
<p>Davis has been one of the most dominant players in the league since entering the NBA as the No. 1 overall pick in 2012. He has averaged 23.2 points, 10.3 rebounds and 2.5 blocks per game over his seven-year career, leading the Pelicans to five playoff appearances.</p>
<p>The Kentucky product was named an All-Star for the sixth time this season and is considered a front-runner for MVP honors. He currently sits second in the league in scoring (27.4 ppg) and first in blocks (3.8 bpg).</p>
<h1 id="Mayweather-Rolls-to-300th-Straight-Victory"><a href="#Mayweather-Rolls-to-300th-Straight-Victory" class="headerlink" title="Mayweather Rolls to 300th Straight Victory"></a>Mayweather Rolls to 300th Straight Victory</h1><p>On Saturday night, Floyd Mayweather rolled to his 300th consecutive victory with a 10th-round knockout of Japanese kickboxer Tenshin Nasukawa.</p>
<p>This was Nasukawa’s big chance to shine on the world stage, but he was no match for Mayweather, who dominated from start to finish.</p>
<p>Mayweather has now won all 51 of his professional fights, and it’s clear that he’s still at the top of his game.</p>
<p>There are rumours that Mayweather will next fight Manny Pacquiao, in what would be another blockbuster bout.</p>
<p>But until that fight is confirmed, Mayweather will enjoy his latest milestone victory.</p>
<h1 id="300-Club-Joined-as-LeBron-James-Netted-Triple-Double-No-300"><a href="#300-Club-Joined-as-LeBron-James-Netted-Triple-Double-No-300" class="headerlink" title="300 Club Joined as LeBron James Netted Triple-Double No. 300"></a>300 Club Joined as LeBron James Netted Triple-Double No. 300</h1><p>In the early hours of Wednesday morning, LeBron James registered his 300th career triple-double in a Lakers’ victory over the Kings. For a player of his stature and with as decorated a career as James has had, the milestone was inevitably met with celebration and fanfare.</p>
<p>“It was an emotional night for me,” James said postgame. “I’m glad to have my friends and family here to witness it.”</p>
<p>James finished with 26 points, 11 rebounds and 13 assists, including five rebounds and six assists in the fourth quarter. He is now fifth all-time in triple-doubles, behind only Oscar Robertson (181), Magic Johnson (138), Jason Kidd (107) and Russell Westbrook (100).</p>
<p>The 300 Club is an illustrious group of NBA players who have reached the 300 mark for career triple-doubles. The list currently boasts just 10 names: James, Westbrook, Kidd, Robertson, Johnson, Larry Bird, LeBron’s teammate Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain and Elgin Baylor.</p>
<p>For players like James and Westbrook who are still adding to their totals, membership in the 300 Club is an evergreen accolade that will only grow more exclusive over time.</p>
<h1 id="Lightning-Struck-3-Times-as-Toronto-Raptors-Won-300th-Game-in-Franchise-History"><a href="#Lightning-Struck-3-Times-as-Toronto-Raptors-Won-300th-Game-in-Franchise-History" class="headerlink" title="Lightning Struck 3 Times as Toronto Raptors Won 300th Game in Franchise History"></a>Lightning Struck 3 Times as Toronto Raptors Won 300th Game in Franchise History</h1><p>TORONTO, ON - The Toronto Raptors won their 300th game in franchise history on Saturday night, as they defeated the Detroit Pistons 103-91.</p>
<p>It was an memorable night for the Raptors organization, as they were also celebrating their 20th anniversary. The team played well, especially in the first half, as they led by as many as 21 points.</p>
<p>Kawhi Leonard led the way for Toronto with 30 points and eight rebounds, while Pascal Siakam added 16 points and 10 rebounds. Kyle Lowry finished with 11 points and 10 assists.</p>
<p>The Raptors didn’t have things go all their way in the second half, as the Pistons made a run and closed the gap to six points early in the fourth quarter. However, Toronto was able to hold on down the stretch and pick up the victory.</p>
<p>This was an important win for Toronto, who are currently in third place in the Eastern Conference standings with a record of 41-16. They are now just two games behind Boston for first place.</p>
<p>The Raptors will look to continue their winning ways when they face off against Philadelphia on Monday night.</p>
<h1 id="Washington-Nationals-Winners-of-300th-Game-in-Franchise-History"><a href="#Washington-Nationals-Winners-of-300th-Game-in-Franchise-History" class="headerlink" title="Washington Nationals Winners of 300th Game in Franchise History"></a>Washington Nationals Winners of 300th Game in Franchise History</h1><p>On Monday night, the Washington Nationals became just the second team in MLB history to win their 300th game as a franchise. The other team being the Atlanta Braves. It was a bit of a pitchers duel between Max Scherzer and Dallas Keuchel. The Nationals however were able to scratch out a run in the 4th inning on a Trea Turner double that scored Adam Eaton. That would be all Scherzer needed as he went 7 innings, striking out 11 and only allowing 1 hit. In the bottom of the 8th inning Ryan Zimmerman came up with 2 outs and runners on first and third base. Zimmerman who is having an MVP caliber season, doubled off of Keuchel to give the Nationals some insurance and eventual final score of 2-0.</p>
<p>This was an important victory for the Nationals as they are now just 2 games back of the Philadelphia Phillies in the NL East Division race. This was also Washington’s 91st victory of the season which is their most since they won 98 games back in 2012. Speaking of 2012, that’s also the last time Washington made it to the playoffs. They were eliminated in 5 games by the St. Louis Cardinals in the National League Division Series that year.</p>
<p>Since then it’s been mostly disappointment for Nationals fans as they’ve failed to make it past even the National League Wild Card Game. Could this finally be their year? With just 18 games remaining in the regular season, it’s definitely still possible. Especially with players like Max Scherzer, Anthony Rendon, Bryce Harper, and Trea Turner leading the way.</p>
<p>With such a tight division race, each game down the stretch is going to be important for Washington. One thing that could be a major advantage for them is their schedule. 17 of their last 18 games are at home with 9 of those coming against teams with losing records (Miami Marlins, New York Mets, Detroit Tigers). If they can take care of business at home and pick up a few wins on the road against teams like Milwaukee Brewers or Colorado Rockies, then there’s no reason why they can’t win their first division title since moving to Washington D.C. back in 2005</p>
