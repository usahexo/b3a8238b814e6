		<h1 id="When-will-online-gambling-become-legalized-in-the-United-States"><a href="#When-will-online-gambling-become-legalized-in-the-United-States" class="headerlink" title="When will online gambling become legalized in the United States?"></a>When will online gambling become legalized in the United States?</h1><p>It is hard to say when online gambling will become legalized in the United States. There are a number of different factors that need to be considered, such as public opinion and the opinion of lawmakers. However, there are some indications that legalization may occur in the near future.</p>
<p>One reason for this is that public opinion has been shifting in favor of online gambling. A growing number of people see it as a way to generate tax revenue and create jobs. In addition, many people believe that it is a safer option than traditional forms of gambling, such as casinos.</p>
<p>Another reason for the potential legalization of online gambling is that many lawmakers are beginning to see it as a way to help shore up state budgets. A number of states are facing budget shortfalls, and online gambling could provide a source of revenue.</p>
<p>There are also a number of political factors that need to be considered. The current administration has been hostile towards legalized gambling, but this could change in the future. In addition, there is currently a bill in Congress that would legalize online gambling on a federal level. This bill has not yet been passed, but it could provide a framework for legalization at the national level.</p>
<p>All of these factors indicate that online gambling may soon be legalized in the United States. While there is no guarantee, the signs point towards eventual legalization.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-becomes-first-state-to-legalize-online-gambling"><a href="#Nevada-becomes-first-state-to-legalize-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Nevada becomes first state to legalize online gambling"></a>Nevada becomes first state to legalize online gambling</h1><p>Nevada has now become the first state in the US to legalize online gambling, with Governor Brian Sandoval signing a bill into law on Tuesday that will allow the Las Vegas Strip and other Nevada casinos to offer Internet poker, blackjack and other games to players located within the state.</p>
<p>The new law allows for up to three licenses to be issued to operators wishing to offer online gambling within Nevada’s borders, and requires that all players be physically located within the state in order to participate. It’s not yet clear when exactly online gambling will go live in Nevada, but officials say they are aiming for sometime this year.</p>
<p>Governor Sandoval said of the new law: “This legislation is critical to our economy and ensuring that we remain competitive with other states in this important industry. It will also create hundreds of good-paying jobs.”</p>
<p>Nevada is not the only state mulling legalizing online gambling; bills are currently pending in California and New Jersey as well. But Nevada is now the first state to actually do so, which could give it a major edge in terms of attracting players and revenues.</p>
<h1 id="California-looks-to-legalize-online-gambling"><a href="#California-looks-to-legalize-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="California looks to legalize online gambling"></a>California looks to legalize online gambling</h1><p>In the early days of the internet, online gambling was in a legal grey area. Many countries had no laws regulating or banning it, and so people could gamble freely on sites like PokerStars and Cake Poker. However, as the years went by some countries started to ban online gambling, while others created regulations surrounding it.</p>
<p>Now, the US state of California is looking to join those countries by legalizing online gambling. The proposed bill – called AB 1677 – would allow Californians to gamble on licensed online casinos, poker sites, and sportsbooks. The bill has been met with some criticism, with some people arguing that it will lead to more gambling addiction and organized crime. However, supporters of the bill argue that it will create jobs and bring in much-needed revenue to the state budget.</p>
<p>If passed, AB 1677 would come into effect on January 1st 2020. It would allow Californians over 21 years of age to gamble on approved websites, and would require those websites to pay a 15% tax on their gross gaming revenue. There would be a limit of $10 per hand or bet for most games, with higher limits for premium games like blackjack and roulette.</p>
<p>So far there is no date set for a vote on the bill, but if it does pass it will be a big win for the online gambling industry. California is one of the biggest markets in the world, so this could pave the way for other states to legalize online gambling too.</p>
<h1 id="Online-gambling-closer-to-becoming-legal-in-New-Jersey"><a href="#Online-gambling-closer-to-becoming-legal-in-New-Jersey" class="headerlink" title="Online gambling closer to becoming legal in New Jersey"></a>Online gambling closer to becoming legal in New Jersey</h1><p>Online gambling is one step closer to becoming legal in the state of New Jersey, after the state Assembly approved a bill that would legalize it. The state Senate had already approved a similar bill, so the next step is for Governor Christie to sign it into law.</p>
<p>If he does, New Jersey will become the third state in the US to legalize online gambling, after Nevada and Delaware. That would mean that residents of those states could place bets on poker and other games on websites operated by licensed casinos.</p>
<p> supporters of the bill argue that it will help boost the economy of New Jersey, which has been struggling since the recession. They also say that it will create jobs, since new casinos will need to be set up to accommodate online gambling.</p>
<p>Opponents of online gambling argue that it is addictive and can lead to financial problems. They also argue that it is easier for children to access gambling websites than traditional casinos.</p>
<p>Governor Christie has not said whether he will sign the bill into law, but he is known to be supportive of legalizing online gambling.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-may-soon-legalize-online-gambling"><a href="#Pennsylvania-may-soon-legalize-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania may soon legalize online gambling"></a>Pennsylvania may soon legalize online gambling</h1><p>Pennsylvania lawmakers are considering legalizing online gambling in the state, a move that could bring in millions of dollars in new revenue.</p>
<p> supporters of the measure say that allowing people to gamble online would help boost the state’s economy, and that it would be a more responsible way to allow gambling than through casinos.</p>
<p>Opponents of the measure argue that online gambling is too risky, and could lead to addiction and other problems.</p>
<p>The bill is currently pending in the state legislature.</p>

		<h1 id="Nevada-Becomes-First-State-to-Allow-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Nevada-Becomes-First-State-to-Allow-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Becomes First State to Allow Online Gambling"></a>Nevada Becomes First State to Allow Online Gambling</h1><p>On Tuesday, the Nevada Senate unanimously passed a bill that would legalize online gambling within the state. The bill, SB331, was sponsored by Senator James Settelmeyer and now awaits the signature of Governor Brian Sandoval.</p>
<p>If signed into law, the bill would allow casinos in Nevada to offer online poker, blackjack, and other casino games to residents of the state. Players would have to be physically located in Nevada in order to participate in the games.</p>
<p>Governor Sandoval has not yet said whether he will sign the bill into law, but he is known to be supportive of online gambling. In a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, Sandoval said that he was “pleased that the Senate has taken this important step” and that he looks forward “to carefully reviewing the legislation.”</p>
<p>Nevada is not the first state to legalize online gambling; both Delaware and New Jersey have already done so. But Nevada would be the first state to allow casino-style games such as blackjack and poker.</p>
<h1 id="U-S-Government-Approves-Online-Gambling"><a href="#U-S-Government-Approves-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="U.S. Government Approves Online Gambling"></a>U.S. Government Approves Online Gambling</h1><p>The U.S. government has approved the legalization of online gambling, as announced by the Department of Justice on Thursday. This new legislation will allow states to legalize and regulate internet gambling within their borders.</p>
<p>This is a landmark decision for the industry, as it opens up a major new market for operators. It is also good news for players, who will now have access to a wider range of gambling options.</p>
<p>The new law will come into effect in 2019, and it will be up to each state to decide whether or not to legalize gambling. There are already a few states that have expressed an interest in doing so, including New Jersey, Nevada and Delaware.</p>
<p>The approval of online gambling is another sign that the U.S. is opening up its gaming market. In December last year, the Federal Communications Commission overturned a ban on sports betting, paving the way for individual states to legalize it.</p>
<h1 id="California-Legalizes-Online-Gambling"><a href="#California-Legalizes-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="California Legalizes Online Gambling"></a>California Legalizes Online Gambling</h1><p>In a unanimous vote by the state’s legislature, California has legalized online gambling. Governor Jerry Brown is expected to sign the bill into law in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>This is considered a major victory for the casino industry, which has been lobbying for years to legalize online gambling. Supporters argue that it will be a major source of new revenue for the state, as well as create jobs.</p>
<p>Opponents of online gambling argue that it will lead to more addiction and money laundering. But those concerns appear to have been outweighed by the potential benefits of legalizing the activity.</p>
<p>Now that California has legalized online gambling, other states are likely to follow suit. This could lead to a nationwide expansion of online gambling, which would be a major win for the casino industry.</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey-Authorizes-Six-Casinos-to-Offer-Online-Gambling"><a href="#New-Jersey-Authorizes-Six-Casinos-to-Offer-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey Authorizes Six Casinos to Offer Online Gambling"></a>New Jersey Authorizes Six Casinos to Offer Online Gambling</h1><p>On Thursday, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie signed a bill into law that authorizes six casinos in the state to offer online gambling.</p>
<p>The casinos will be able to offer a variety of casino games, including blackjack, roulette, and poker, to players within New Jersey.</p>
<p>Players will need to be physically located within the state in order to participate in the online gambling games.</p>
<p>“Today marks a new era for gaming in New Jersey and provides a further catalyst for economic growth in our state,” said Governor Christie.</p>
<p>The new law is expected to generate $1 billion in revenue for New Jersey over the next five years.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Becomes-Third-State-to-Legalize-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Delaware-Becomes-Third-State-to-Legalize-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Becomes Third State to Legalize Online Gambling"></a>Delaware Becomes Third State to Legalize Online Gambling</h1><p>On Tuesday, June 5, 2018, Delaware’s Senate passed a bill that legalizes online gambling within the state. This makes Delaware the third state in the U.S. to legalize online gambling, following New Jersey and Nevada.</p>
<p>Under the proposed bill, players would be able to gamble on casino games such as roulette, blackjack, and poker through their computers or mobile devices. The Delaware Lottery would oversee and regulate the new industry.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill argue that it will help bolster Delaware’s flagging casino industry. According to estimates from the Delaware Lottery, legalizing online gambling could bring in an additional $7 million in annual revenue for the state.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to more gambling addiction and other social problems. They also worry that it could give an unfair competitive advantage to Delaware’s casinos over those in other states.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives still needs to approve the bill before it becomes law.</p>

This caused all tournaments in progress to be canceled, and the casino is not expected to resume operation until later this evening.</p>
<p>Players were understandably frustrated by the sudden loss of power. “I had almost won my tournament,” said one player. “This is just unfair.”</p>
<p>While there is no word on when the casino will resume operations, we will update this article as soon as more information becomes available.</p>
<h1 id="Double-Down-Casino-Announces-New-Tournament-Schedule"><a href="#Double-Down-Casino-Announces-New-Tournament-Schedule" class="headerlink" title="Double Down Casino Announces New Tournament Schedule"></a>Double Down Casino Announces New Tournament Schedule</h1><p>The popular online casino, Double Down Casino, has just announced a new tournament schedule for its players. This includes a variety of tournaments with different buy-in levels and prizes up for grabs.</p>
<p>The new schedule kicks off on September 1st with the “All September Power-Up” tournament. This event will have a $3 buy-in and players can compete for a share of the $1,000 prize pool. There are also several other tournaments taking place in September, including a $10 buy-in tournament with a $2,500 prize pool and a $75 buy-in tournament with a $10,000 prize pool.</p>
<p>Players can find the full schedule on the Double Down Casino website or on the casino’s Facebook page. There is something for everyone, no matter what your budget or gaming preferences may be. So be sure to check out the new schedule and start planning your poker tournaments today!</p>
<h1 id="Double-Down-Casino-Experiences-Server-Issues-Tournaments-Reset"><a href="#Double-Down-Casino-Experiences-Server-Issues-Tournaments-Reset" class="headerlink" title="Double Down Casino Experiences Server Issues - Tournaments Reset"></a>Double Down Casino Experiences Server Issues - Tournaments Reset</h1><p>For several hours on Monday, July 16th, Double Down Casino was unavailable for players around the world. This outage caused frustration for those trying to enjoy their favorite casino games, as well as tournament participants whose progress was reset.</p>
<p>The Double Down Casino Twitter account acknowledged the issue and advised players that the server was being worked on. Unfortunately, the resumption of service didn’t happen until later in the day, meaning many people had their tournaments reset or were simply unable to play at all.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time Double Down Casino has had server issues. In March 2018, there were similar problems that caused players to lose their progress in tournaments and games. At that time, a statement from parent company DoubleDown Interactive read: “We are aware of issues that arose this morning impacting some of our players’ experience and we apologize for the inconvenience. Our team is working hard to resolve these issues as quickly as possible.”</p>
<p>It’s unclear whether Monday’s outage was similarly due to high demand or if there was another problem. Either way, it’s frustrating for players who lost their progress and had to start tournaments over from scratch. Let’s hope that Double Down Casino can get its servers sorted out soon so that these types of issues don’t continue to occur.</p>

<p>The app is known for its casino-style games, including blackjack, slots, and roulette. However, players were unable to access any of these games on Saturday due to an outage.</p>
<p>Many took to social media to express their frustration with the outage. Some said that they had been waiting for hours for the tournament feature to come back online.</p>
<p>Others said that they had lost a lot of money in the blackout period. One player claimed to have lost $500 in just 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Double Down Casino has not yet commented on the outage. It is unclear when the tournaments feature will be back online.</p>

And not only that, but everyone who was impacted by the shutdown will be given complimentary chips as a way of making up for the lost time.</p>
<p>According to an announcement from the company, the decision to halt tournaments last week was made in order to improve their processes and make sure that future outages don’t happen. And while it was an unfortunate turn of events for those who were in the middle of a tournament when it stopped, they’re hoping that this move will show that they’re serious about providing a quality product.</p>
<p>The complimentary chips being offered are worth $10 each, and can be redeemed by logging into your account and clicking on the gift icon. You’ll then have the option to claim your free chips, which will be added to your account immediately.</p>
<p>It’s unclear at this point how long the tournaments will be down for, but we’ll be sure to update this article as more information becomes available.

This addition has many casino-goers scratching their heads, wondering why the developers would add such an element to the classic card game.</p>
<p>After some careful thought, we at Huuuge Casino believe that the diamonds were added to blackjack in order to increase player engagement. By adding a new layer of excitement and potential reward to the game, players are likely to stick around longer and interact with the software more regularly.</p>
<p>In addition, diamonds could also be seen as a way of motivating players to make larger bets. By giving players something valuable to aim for – and potentially win – casinos can encourage them to bet more money on each hand.</p>
<p>Whichever reason the developers had for adding diamonds to blackjack, we at Huuuge Casino are just glad that they did! Our players are already enjoying this exciting new twist on a classic game, and we can’t wait to see what other innovations they come up with in the future.</p>

<p>There are several different ways to shave beards, and the lsletan casino provides all of the necessary tools and information so that players can shave them in the most effective way possible.</p>
<p>Shaving beards is not just a fun pastime – it can also be profitable. So if you have a beard, why not shave it off and see how much money you can win?</p>
<h1 id="No-More-Beards-at-the-LSletan-Casino-–-Time-to-Shave"><a href="#No-More-Beards-at-the-LSletan-Casino-–-Time-to-Shave" class="headerlink" title="No More Beards at the LSletan Casino – Time to Shave!"></a>No More Beards at the LSletan Casino – Time to Shave!</h1><p>It’s been a few months now since the news of the new no-beard policy at LSletan Casino spread around the internet. The initial reaction to the news was mostly disbelief with a little bit of outrage thrown in for good measure. </p>
<p>However, as more and more people have had a chance to see the new policy in action, it’s become clear that this is actually a great change for the casino. Shaving is becoming more and more popular these days, and there’s no reason why LSletan Casino can’t capitalize on that trend. </p>
<p>There are some who argue that beards make people look more approachable or trustworthy. However, studies have actually shown that beards are often associated with negative traits like untrustworthiness and uncleanliness. In fact, one study found that beards can reduce trust by up to 50%. </p>
<p>That’s not to say that everyone views beards negatively – there are plenty of people who love beards and think they look great. But the bottom line is that LSletan Casino is trying to appeal to as many people as possible, and that means getting rid of the bearded guys. </p>
<p>Shaving isn’t just about appearances though. It’s also about hygiene. Beards can trap all sorts of bacteria and dirt, which can lead to skin problems like acne and folliculitis. So not only do beards look bad, they can also make you sick. </p>
<p>There’s no doubt that shaving can be a little bit inconvenient, but it’s worth it for the benefits it provides. LSletan Casino has made the right decision in implementing this new policy, and I hope other casinos follow their lead.</p>
