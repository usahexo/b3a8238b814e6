In its simplest form, eco-friendly means practices, products and lifestyles that have a positive impact on the environment. It encompasses everything from reducing your carbon footprint to using sustainable materials in your home.">

	  <h1 id="Nevada-Becomes-First-State-to-Allow-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Nevada-Becomes-First-State-to-Allow-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Becomes First State to Allow Online Gambling"></a>Nevada Becomes First State to Allow Online Gambling</h1><p>On Tuesday, the Nevada Senate unanimously passed a bill that would legalize online gambling within the state. The bill, SB331, was sponsored by Senator James Settelmeyer and now awaits the signature of Governor Brian Sandoval.</p>
<p>If signed into law, the bill would allow casinos in Nevada to offer online poker, blackjack, and other casino games to residents of the state. Players would have to be physically located in Nevada in order to participate in the games.</p>
<p>Governor Sandoval has not yet said whether he will sign the bill into law, but he is known to be supportive of online gambling. In a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, Sandoval said that he was “pleased that the Senate has taken this important step” and that he looks forward “to carefully reviewing the legislation.”</p>
<p>Nevada is not the first state to legalize online gambling; both Delaware and New Jersey have already done so. But Nevada would be the first state to allow casino-style games such as blackjack and poker.</p>
<h1 id="U-S-Government-Approves-Online-Gambling"><a href="#U-S-Government-Approves-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="U.S. Government Approves Online Gambling"></a>U.S. Government Approves Online Gambling</h1><p>The U.S. government has approved the legalization of online gambling, as announced by the Department of Justice on Thursday. This new legislation will allow states to legalize and regulate internet gambling within their borders.</p>
<p>This is a landmark decision for the industry, as it opens up a major new market for operators. It is also good news for players, who will now have access to a wider range of gambling options.</p>
<p>The new law will come into effect in 2019, and it will be up to each state to decide whether or not to legalize gambling. There are already a few states that have expressed an interest in doing so, including New Jersey, Nevada and Delaware.</p>
<p>The approval of online gambling is another sign that the U.S. is opening up its gaming market. In December last year, the Federal Communications Commission overturned a ban on sports betting, paving the way for individual states to legalize it.</p>
<h1 id="California-Legalizes-Online-Gambling"><a href="#California-Legalizes-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="California Legalizes Online Gambling"></a>California Legalizes Online Gambling</h1><p>In a unanimous vote by the state’s legislature, California has legalized online gambling. Governor Jerry Brown is expected to sign the bill into law in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>This is considered a major victory for the casino industry, which has been lobbying for years to legalize online gambling. Supporters argue that it will be a major source of new revenue for the state, as well as create jobs.</p>
<p>Opponents of online gambling argue that it will lead to more addiction and money laundering. But those concerns appear to have been outweighed by the potential benefits of legalizing the activity.</p>
<p>Now that California has legalized online gambling, other states are likely to follow suit. This could lead to a nationwide expansion of online gambling, which would be a major win for the casino industry.</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey-Authorizes-Six-Casinos-to-Offer-Online-Gambling"><a href="#New-Jersey-Authorizes-Six-Casinos-to-Offer-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey Authorizes Six Casinos to Offer Online Gambling"></a>New Jersey Authorizes Six Casinos to Offer Online Gambling</h1><p>On Thursday, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie signed a bill into law that authorizes six casinos in the state to offer online gambling.</p>
<p>The casinos will be able to offer a variety of casino games, including blackjack, roulette, and poker, to players within New Jersey.</p>
<p>Players will need to be physically located within the state in order to participate in the online gambling games.</p>
<p>“Today marks a new era for gaming in New Jersey and provides a further catalyst for economic growth in our state,” said Governor Christie.</p>
<p>The new law is expected to generate $1 billion in revenue for New Jersey over the next five years.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Becomes-Third-State-to-Legalize-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Delaware-Becomes-Third-State-to-Legalize-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Becomes Third State to Legalize Online Gambling"></a>Delaware Becomes Third State to Legalize Online Gambling</h1><p>On Tuesday, June 5, 2018, Delaware’s Senate passed a bill that legalizes online gambling within the state. This makes Delaware the third state in the U.S. to legalize online gambling, following New Jersey and Nevada.</p>
<p>Under the proposed bill, players would be able to gamble on casino games such as roulette, blackjack, and poker through their computers or mobile devices. The Delaware Lottery would oversee and regulate the new industry.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill argue that it will help bolster Delaware’s flagging casino industry. According to estimates from the Delaware Lottery, legalizing online gambling could bring in an additional $7 million in annual revenue for the state.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to more gambling addiction and other social problems. They also worry that it could give an unfair competitive advantage to Delaware’s casinos over those in other states.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives still needs to approve the bill before it becomes law.</p>
