	  <h1 id="When-will-online-gambling-become-legalized-in-the-United-States"><a href="#When-will-online-gambling-become-legalized-in-the-United-States" class="headerlink" title="When will online gambling become legalized in the United States?"></a>When will online gambling become legalized in the United States?</h1><p>It is hard to say when online gambling will become legalized in the United States. There are a number of different factors that need to be considered, such as public opinion and the opinion of lawmakers. However, there are some indications that legalization may occur in the near future.</p>
<p>One reason for this is that public opinion has been shifting in favor of online gambling. A growing number of people see it as a way to generate tax revenue and create jobs. In addition, many people believe that it is a safer option than traditional forms of gambling, such as casinos.</p>
<p>Another reason for the potential legalization of online gambling is that many lawmakers are beginning to see it as a way to help shore up state budgets. A number of states are facing budget shortfalls, and online gambling could provide a source of revenue.</p>
<p>There are also a number of political factors that need to be considered. The current administration has been hostile towards legalized gambling, but this could change in the future. In addition, there is currently a bill in Congress that would legalize online gambling on a federal level. This bill has not yet been passed, but it could provide a framework for legalization at the national level.</p>
<p>All of these factors indicate that online gambling may soon be legalized in the United States. While there is no guarantee, the signs point towards eventual legalization.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-becomes-first-state-to-legalize-online-gambling"><a href="#Nevada-becomes-first-state-to-legalize-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Nevada becomes first state to legalize online gambling"></a>Nevada becomes first state to legalize online gambling</h1><p>Nevada has now become the first state in the US to legalize online gambling, with Governor Brian Sandoval signing a bill into law on Tuesday that will allow the Las Vegas Strip and other Nevada casinos to offer Internet poker, blackjack and other games to players located within the state.</p>
<p>The new law allows for up to three licenses to be issued to operators wishing to offer online gambling within Nevada’s borders, and requires that all players be physically located within the state in order to participate. It’s not yet clear when exactly online gambling will go live in Nevada, but officials say they are aiming for sometime this year.</p>
<p>Governor Sandoval said of the new law: “This legislation is critical to our economy and ensuring that we remain competitive with other states in this important industry. It will also create hundreds of good-paying jobs.”</p>
<p>Nevada is not the only state mulling legalizing online gambling; bills are currently pending in California and New Jersey as well. But Nevada is now the first state to actually do so, which could give it a major edge in terms of attracting players and revenues.</p>
<h1 id="California-looks-to-legalize-online-gambling"><a href="#California-looks-to-legalize-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="California looks to legalize online gambling"></a>California looks to legalize online gambling</h1><p>In the early days of the internet, online gambling was in a legal grey area. Many countries had no laws regulating or banning it, and so people could gamble freely on sites like PokerStars and Cake Poker. However, as the years went by some countries started to ban online gambling, while others created regulations surrounding it.</p>
<p>Now, the US state of California is looking to join those countries by legalizing online gambling. The proposed bill – called AB 1677 – would allow Californians to gamble on licensed online casinos, poker sites, and sportsbooks. The bill has been met with some criticism, with some people arguing that it will lead to more gambling addiction and organized crime. However, supporters of the bill argue that it will create jobs and bring in much-needed revenue to the state budget.</p>
<p>If passed, AB 1677 would come into effect on January 1st 2020. It would allow Californians over 21 years of age to gamble on approved websites, and would require those websites to pay a 15% tax on their gross gaming revenue. There would be a limit of $10 per hand or bet for most games, with higher limits for premium games like blackjack and roulette.</p>
<p>So far there is no date set for a vote on the bill, but if it does pass it will be a big win for the online gambling industry. California is one of the biggest markets in the world, so this could pave the way for other states to legalize online gambling too.</p>
<h1 id="Online-gambling-closer-to-becoming-legal-in-New-Jersey"><a href="#Online-gambling-closer-to-becoming-legal-in-New-Jersey" class="headerlink" title="Online gambling closer to becoming legal in New Jersey"></a>Online gambling closer to becoming legal in New Jersey</h1><p>Online gambling is one step closer to becoming legal in the state of New Jersey, after the state Assembly approved a bill that would legalize it. The state Senate had already approved a similar bill, so the next step is for Governor Christie to sign it into law.</p>
<p>If he does, New Jersey will become the third state in the US to legalize online gambling, after Nevada and Delaware. That would mean that residents of those states could place bets on poker and other games on websites operated by licensed casinos.</p>
<p> supporters of the bill argue that it will help boost the economy of New Jersey, which has been struggling since the recession. They also say that it will create jobs, since new casinos will need to be set up to accommodate online gambling.</p>
<p>Opponents of online gambling argue that it is addictive and can lead to financial problems. They also argue that it is easier for children to access gambling websites than traditional casinos.</p>
<p>Governor Christie has not said whether he will sign the bill into law, but he is known to be supportive of legalizing online gambling.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-may-soon-legalize-online-gambling"><a href="#Pennsylvania-may-soon-legalize-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania may soon legalize online gambling"></a>Pennsylvania may soon legalize online gambling</h1><p>Pennsylvania lawmakers are considering legalizing online gambling in the state, a move that could bring in millions of dollars in new revenue.</p>
<p> supporters of the measure say that allowing people to gamble online would help boost the state’s economy, and that it would be a more responsible way to allow gambling than through casinos.</p>
<p>Opponents of the measure argue that online gambling is too risky, and could lead to addiction and other problems.</p>
<p>The bill is currently pending in the state legislature.</p>
