<h1 id="Gambling-and-Bob’s-Burgers-A-match-made-in-heaven"><a href="#Gambling-and-Bob’s-Burgers-A-match-made-in-heaven" class="headerlink" title="Gambling and Bob’s Burgers? A match made in heaven!"></a>Gambling and Bob’s Burgers? A match made in heaven!</h1><p>If you’re a fan of the TV show Bob’s Burgers, there’s no doubt you’ve noticed all of the hilarious gambling references throughout the series. From Louise’s illegal casino in her treehouse to Bob’s botched attempt at playing blackjack in order to win back his restaurant, gambling is a recurring theme on the show. So why is gambling such a big part of Bob’s Burgers?</p>
<p>As it turns out, the show’s creators are themselves big fans of gambling, and they’ve used the show as a way to work in some of their own personal experiences with gambling. In an interview with Vulture, creator Loren Bouchard explained, “Gambling is something that we’re all interested in and attracted to, because there’s so much at stake. It’s life and death in a sense.”</p>
<p>And it’s not just the creators who are into gambling – many of the show’s cast and crew are too. In fact, actor Jon Hamm even has a bit of a gambling addiction and was forced to seek treatment for it several years ago.</p>
<p>So why is Bob’s Burgers so obsessed with gambling? According to Bouchard, it’s because “gambling is about making calculated risks, and that feels very Bob’s Burgers to us.” And we can’t help but agree! The characters on Bob’s Burgers are always taking risks, and the gambles they take always lead to some hilarious moments.</p>
<p>Whether you’re a fan of gambling or not, there’s no denying that Bob’s Burgers has some of the funniest references to it out there. If you want to see for yourself, be sure to check out some of the best ones below!</p>

The entire episode is filled with hilarious jokes and puns, and the plot is intriguing and suspenseful.

The episode is brilliantly written and animated, and it’s sure to make you laugh out loud.</p>
<h1 id="This-episode-of-Bob’s-Burgers-is-sure-to-please-everyone-who-loves-both-gambling-and-cartoons"><a href="#This-episode-of-Bob’s-Burgers-is-sure-to-please-everyone-who-loves-both-gambling-and-cartoons" class="headerlink" title="This episode of Bob’s Burgers is sure to please everyone who loves both gambling and cartoons!"></a>This episode of Bob’s Burgers is sure to please everyone who loves both gambling and cartoons!</h1><p>In “The Great Scamandwich,” Bob opens up a scam sandwich shop right next to Jimmy Pesto’s pizzeria in order to get back at his competitor. But as it turns out, scam sandwiches are a lot harder to make than regular ones, and the Belchers quickly find themselves in over their heads.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tina takes up gambling with her new friend Tammy, and quickly becomes obsessed with trying to win back her lost money. She even starts betting on simple things like who will win a game of rock-paper-scissors!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things don’t go well for either the Belchers or Tina. The scam sandwich shop closes down after just one day, and Tina loses all her money in a series of bad bets.</p>
<p>But even though they come up short this time around, the Belchers can always be counted on to have some fun along the way. And that’s what makes Bob’s Burgers so great: it’s a show that can make you laugh and think at the same time.</p>
