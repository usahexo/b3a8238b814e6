  <meta name="description" content="The term “eco-friendly” is tossed around quite a bit, but what does it actually mean? In its simplest form, eco-friendly means practices, products and lifestyles that have a positive impact on the environment. It encompasses everything from reducing your carbon footprint to using sustainable materials in your home.">

	  <h1 id="Double-Down-Casino-Loses-Power-All-Tournaments-Canceled"><a href="#Double-Down-Casino-Loses-Power-All-Tournaments-Canceled" class="headerlink" title="Double Down Casino Loses Power - All Tournaments Canceled"></a>Double Down Casino Loses Power - All Tournaments Canceled</h1><p>At approximately 2pm ET, the Double Down Casino lost power. This caused all tournaments in progress to be canceled, and the casino is not expected to resume operation until later this evening.</p>
<p>Players were understandably frustrated by the sudden loss of power. “I had almost won my tournament,” said one player. “This is just unfair.”</p>
<p>While there is no word on when the casino will resume operations, we will update this article as soon as more information becomes available.</p>
<h1 id="Double-Down-Casino-Announces-New-Tournament-Schedule"><a href="#Double-Down-Casino-Announces-New-Tournament-Schedule" class="headerlink" title="Double Down Casino Announces New Tournament Schedule"></a>Double Down Casino Announces New Tournament Schedule</h1><p>The popular online casino, Double Down Casino, has just announced a new tournament schedule for its players. This includes a variety of tournaments with different buy-in levels and prizes up for grabs.</p>
<p>The new schedule kicks off on September 1st with the “All September Power-Up” tournament. This event will have a $3 buy-in and players can compete for a share of the $1,000 prize pool. There are also several other tournaments taking place in September, including a $10 buy-in tournament with a $2,500 prize pool and a $75 buy-in tournament with a $10,000 prize pool.</p>
<p>Players can find the full schedule on the Double Down Casino website or on the casino’s Facebook page. There is something for everyone, no matter what your budget or gaming preferences may be. So be sure to check out the new schedule and start planning your poker tournaments today!</p>
<h1 id="Double-Down-Casino-Experiences-Server-Issues-Tournaments-Reset"><a href="#Double-Down-Casino-Experiences-Server-Issues-Tournaments-Reset" class="headerlink" title="Double Down Casino Experiences Server Issues - Tournaments Reset"></a>Double Down Casino Experiences Server Issues - Tournaments Reset</h1><p>For several hours on Monday, July 16th, Double Down Casino was unavailable for players around the world. This outage caused frustration for those trying to enjoy their favorite casino games, as well as tournament participants whose progress was reset.</p>
<p>The Double Down Casino Twitter account acknowledged the issue and advised players that the server was being worked on. Unfortunately, the resumption of service didn’t happen until later in the day, meaning many people had their tournaments reset or were simply unable to play at all.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time Double Down Casino has had server issues. In March 2018, there were similar problems that caused players to lose their progress in tournaments and games. At that time, a statement from parent company DoubleDown Interactive read: “We are aware of issues that arose this morning impacting some of our players’ experience and we apologize for the inconvenience. Our team is working hard to resolve these issues as quickly as possible.”</p>
<p>It’s unclear whether Monday’s outage was similarly due to high demand or if there was another problem. Either way, it’s frustrating for players who lost their progress and had to start tournaments over from scratch. Let’s hope that Double Down Casino can get its servers sorted out soon so that these types of issues don’t continue to occur.</p>
<h1 id="Players-Left-Frustrated-After-Double-Down-Casino-Tournaments-Goes-Offline"><a href="#Players-Left-Frustrated-After-Double-Down-Casino-Tournaments-Goes-Offline" class="headerlink" title="Players Left Frustrated After Double Down Casino Tournaments Goes Offline"></a>Players Left Frustrated After Double Down Casino Tournaments Goes Offline</h1><p>Players of Double Down Casino were left frustrated on Saturday after the tournaments feature of the app went offline.</p>
<p>The app is known for its casino-style games, including blackjack, slots, and roulette. However, players were unable to access any of these games on Saturday due to an outage.</p>
<p>Many took to social media to express their frustration with the outage. Some said that they had been waiting for hours for the tournament feature to come back online.</p>
<p>Others said that they had lost a lot of money in the blackout period. One player claimed to have lost $500 in just 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Double Down Casino has not yet commented on the outage. It is unclear when the tournaments feature will be back online.</p>
<h1 id="Double-Down-Casino-Restarts-Tournaments-Offers-Complimentary-Chips-to-Make-Up-For-Lost-Time"><a href="#Double-Down-Casino-Restarts-Tournaments-Offers-Complimentary-Chips-to-Make-Up-For-Lost-Time" class="headerlink" title="Double Down Casino Restarts Tournaments, Offers Complimentary Chips to Make Up For Lost Time"></a>Double Down Casino Restarts Tournaments, Offers Complimentary Chips to Make Up For Lost Time</h1><p>If you were a part of the many players who were left waiting when Double Down Casino’s tournaments suddenly stopped last week, you’ll be glad to hear that they’ve now restarted. And not only that, but everyone who was impacted by the shutdown will be given complimentary chips as a way of making up for the lost time.</p>
<p>According to an announcement from the company, the decision to halt tournaments last week was made in order to improve their processes and make sure that future outages don’t happen. And while it was an unfortunate turn of events for those who were in the middle of a tournament when it stopped, they’re hoping that this move will show that they’re serious about providing a quality product.</p>
<p>The complimentary chips being offered are worth $10 each, and can be redeemed by logging into your account and clicking on the gift icon. You’ll then have the option to claim your free chips, which will be added to your account immediately.</p>
<p>It’s unclear at this point how long the tournaments will be down for, but we’ll be sure to update this article as more information becomes available. In the meantime, we recommend checking out our list of best online casinos for Canadians if you’re looking for an alternative place to play.</p>
