In its simplest form, eco-friendly means practices, products and lifestyles that have a positive impact on the environment. It encompasses everything from reducing your carbon footprint to using sustainable materials in your home.">

This disastrous season saw them relegated from Spain’s top flight, and they will now have to rebuild in order to return to the top flight.</p>
<p>The fans had to say goodbye to their heroes Antoine Griezmann and Lucas Hernandez, who both left for Barcelona and Bayern Munich respectively. Diego Simeone also left the club after deciding that it was time for a change. He has been replaced by former River Plate manager Matias Almeyda.</p>
<p>The new manager will have his work cut out for him, as he looks to rebuild a side that failed miserably last season. There are some good young players at the club, such as Joao Felix, who could be part of the team for many years to come. However, they will need some experienced players as well if they are to make an immediate return to La Liga.</p>
<h1 id="Atletico-Madrid-suffers-relegation-from-La-Liga"><a href="#Atletico-Madrid-suffers-relegation-from-La-Liga" class="headerlink" title="Atlético Madrid suffers relegation from La Liga"></a>Atlético Madrid suffers relegation from La Liga</h1><p>Atlético Madrid has been relegated from La Liga after a poor season saw the club finish in 20th place. The club had a woeful campaign, winning just 6 games all season and suffering 18 defeats. This is the first time Atlético has been relegated from La Liga since they were promoted back to the top flight in 2002.</p>
<p>The Madrid-based side were expected to challenge for European qualification this season but instead they finished bottom of the table, 5 points behind Leganés in 17th place. Atlético’s downfall was largely due to their poor home form, as they won just 2 games at the Vicente Calderón Stadium all season.</p>
<p>Their relegation will come as a huge shock to many fans and players alike, particularly as Atlético have enjoyed so much success in recent years. The club reached the final of the Champions League in 2014 and 2016, losing out to Real Madrid on both occasions. They also won La Liga in 2014 and have finished 3rd and 2nd in the last two seasons respectively.</p>
<p>With Diego Simeone set to leave the club at the end of the season, Atlético now face an uncertain future. They will need to invest heavily in order to rebuild their squad and compete back at the top level of Spanish football.</p>
<h1 id="Atleti-dismissed-from-European-competition-in-group-stage"><a href="#Atleti-dismissed-from-European-competition-in-group-stage" class="headerlink" title="Atleti dismissed from European competition in group stage"></a>Atleti dismissed from European competition in group stage</h1><h1 id="Diego-Simeone’s-side-finished-behind-Borussia-Dortmund-and-Monaco"><a href="#Diego-Simeone’s-side-finished-behind-Borussia-Dortmund-and-Monaco" class="headerlink" title="Diego Simeone’s side finished behind Borussia Dortmund and Monaco"></a>Diego Simeone’s side finished behind Borussia Dortmund and Monaco</h1><p>The Champions League campaign of Atlético Madrid has come to an end after they were dismissed from the European competition in the group stage.</p>
<p>Diego Simeone’s side finished behind Borussia Dortmund and Monaco in the group, which meant that they had to face La Liga rivals Barcelona in the last-16 round.</p>
<p>Atlético Madrid played well against the Catalans, but they eventually lost the tie by a 3-2 aggregate scoreline.</p>
<p>Now, their attention will turn back to La Liga, where they will have to battle for the title against Real Madrid and Barcelona.</p>
<h1 id="Simeone’s-contract-not-renewed-club-looks-for-new-manager"><a href="#Simeone’s-contract-not-renewed-club-looks-for-new-manager" class="headerlink" title="Simeone’s contract not renewed; club looks for new manager"></a>Simeone’s contract not renewed; club looks for new manager</h1><p>After much speculation, Atlético Madrid has announced that manager Diego Simeone will not be renewing his contract with the club. Atlético is now in the market for a new head coach.</p>
<p>Simeone, who has been at the helm of the Spanish club since 2011, led Atlético to a La Liga championship in 2014 and to two Champions League finals, in both instances losing to cross-town rivals Real Madrid.</p>
<p>The Argentinian manager’s contract was set to expire at the end of this season, and there had been rampant speculation about whether he would stay or go. Simeone himself had remained coy on his future, but he has now decided to leave Atlético after seven years in charge.</p>
<p>“I want to thank Atleti for giving me the opportunity to coach this team,” Simeone said in a statement released by the club. “It’s been an incredible experience, but I have decided that it’s time for me to move on. I want to thank all of the players, coaches and staff who have helped me over the years. I also want to apologize to the fans for not being able to bring more success to the club. I will always be grateful for their support.”</p>
<p>Atlético did not give a specific reason why Simeone is leaving, but it is widely believed that he was unwilling to sign a new contract with a reduced role after previously having total control over all aspects of the team.</p>
<p>Now that Simeone is gone, Atlético will have its work cut out trying to find a replacement who can replicate his success. The most likely candidates are currently assistant manager Mono Burgos and Portuguese manager Luís Filipe Scolari, but neither is likely to command as much respect as Simeone among the players or fans.</p>
<h1 id="Club-Atletico-de-Madrid-officially-declares-bankruptcy"><a href="#Club-Atletico-de-Madrid-officially-declares-bankruptcy" class="headerlink" title="Club Atlético de Madrid officially declares bankruptcy"></a>Club Atlético de Madrid officially declares bankruptcy</h1><p>Club Atlético de Madrid filed for bankruptcy on Tuesday, September 3, 2019. The filing was made in the wake of the club’s failure to repay a €500 million loan from Spanish banking giant Banco Santander. This is the second time in four years that Atlético has declared bankruptcy; the club previously filed for Chapter 15 protection in 2016.</p>
<p> Atlético has been in financial trouble for some time, owing debts to both government agencies and private creditors. The club’s management had been working to restructure its debt, but negotiations with Santander broke down earlier this year. In announcing its bankruptcy filing, Atlético said it hoped to negotiate a debt restructuring agreement with its creditors.</p>
<p>The move is a major blow to Atlético, which is one of Spain’s most successful clubs. The team has won ten La Liga titles and two Champions League trophies. It is also widely popular outside of Spain; Atlético’s players include English Premier League stars Antoine Griezmann and Harry Kane.</p>
<p>The bankruptcy will likely have serious consequences for the club. Among other things, it could lead to a ban from European competition if Atlético cannot resolve its financial problems.</p>
