While there are many different versions of the game, all of which involve betting on the outcome of a spinning wheel, they all play out a bit differently. Here is a look at how to play some of the more popular roulette variations:</p>
<p>European Roulette: This version of the game uses a single zero slot on the wheel, increasing your chances of winning compared to American roulette. To play, place your chips on the table where you think the ball will land after it spins.</p>
<p>American Roulette: With two zero slots on the wheel, American roulette has slightly worse odds than European roulette. To play, place your chips on the table in the following manner: Outside bets cover larger areas of the table and have lower payouts than inside bets, which are placed on specific numbers or groups of numbers.</p>
<p>French Roulette: This variation uses the same rules as European roulette, but gives players slightly better odds thanks to one additional rule - La Partage. With La Partage, half of any bet placed on even money bets (black/red, high/low) is returned to players if the ball lands in the zero slot.</p>
<p>Double Ball Roulette: This unique version of roulette features two balls instead of one. As the name suggests, this increases your chances of winning significantly, as there are twice as many potential winning combinations. To play, simply bet on which number both balls will end up on after spinning.</p>
<h1 id="Roulette-Games-with-Higher-Odds-Available-at-Online-Casinos"><a href="#Roulette-Games-with-Higher-Odds-Available-at-Online-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="Roulette Games with Higher Odds Available at Online Casinos"></a>Roulette Games with Higher Odds Available at Online Casinos</h1><p>By now, most people are familiar with roulette and the basic game play. The game is typically played with a wheel that has 37 or 38 slots numbered 0-36, with a ball that is spun around the rim and falls into one of the slots. Players bet on where they think the ball will end up, with different betting options available depending on the particular game variant.</p>
<p>While the vast majority of roulette games offered at online casinos are based on the European version of the game with odds of 1 in 37 (or 2.7%), there are a number of variants that offer higher odds. For example, Double Ball Roulette from LeoVegas features two balls instead of one, which means that there are twice as many potential winning combinations. This increases the odds to 1 in 18 (or 5.5%).</p>
<p>Other variants with higher odds include Premier Roulette Diamond Edition from Playtech, which has odds of 1 in 49 (2.04%), and Zoom Roulette from Evolution Gaming, which has odds of 1 in 81 (1.23%). So if you’re looking for a game with a bit more excitement and better chances of winning, be sure to check out some of these variants at your favourite online casino.</p>

In this article, we’ll take a look at the most popular types of roulette games available.</p>
<h1 id="European-Roulette"><a href="#European-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="European Roulette"></a>European Roulette</h1><p>European roulette is the most common type of roulette game found at online casinos. The game uses a single green zero and 36 numbered slots running from 1 to 36. Players can make inside and outside bets, and the house edge is 2.7%.</p>
<h1 id="American-Roulette"><a href="#American-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="American Roulette"></a>American Roulette</h1><p>American roulette is very similar to European roulette, but with one significant difference - the addition of a double zero. This increases the house edge to 5.26%.</p>
<h1 id="French-Roulette"><a href="#French-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="French Roulette"></a>French Roulette</h1><p>French roulette is another variation on the classic game. It uses the same rules as European roulette, but features a different layout on the table with more betting options. The house edge is lower than American or European roulette (2.7%), making it a popular choice for players.</p>
<h1 id="Multi-Wheel-Roulette"><a href="#Multi-Wheel-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="Multi-Wheel Roulette"></a>Multi-Wheel Roulette</h1><p>Multi-wheel roulette allows players to bet on multiple wheels at once. This increases the excitement of the game, as well as your chances of winning! The house edge for multi-wheel roulette is 3.63%.</p>
<h1 id="The-Best-Roulette-Games-to-Play-in-an-Online-Casino"><a href="#The-Best-Roulette-Games-to-Play-in-an-Online-Casino" class="headerlink" title="The Best Roulette Games to Play in an Online Casino"></a>The Best Roulette Games to Play in an Online Casino</h1><p>There are many different casino games to choose from when you decide to gamble online. Roulette is one of the most popular, and there are many variations of the game that you can play.</p>
<p>Roulette has been around for centuries and is believed to have originated in France. The game is simple to play, but there is a certain amount of skill involved in making successful bets. If you are new to the game, it is important to learn the basics before you start playing for real money.</p>
<p>There are a few different types of roulette that you can play online. American roulette has 38 numbers, including 0 and 00. European roulette only has 37 numbers and is considered to be the more favourable version of the game, as the odds are slightly better. French roulette is similar to European roulette, but has a different betting layout.</p>
<p>When playing roulette online, you will need to make a number of decisions before you start betting. The first decision is whether to bet on a single number or on a range of numbers. You can also bet on whether the ball will land in black or red, odd or even, or high or low numbers. There are also several special bets that you can make, such as betting on four numbers at once or betting on whether two specific numbers will appear next to each other on the wheel.</p>
<p>Once you have decided how you want to bet, it’s time to place your chips on the table. Each gambling site will have its own set of rules about how much money you can bet at once, so be sure to read these before you start playing. Most sites will also have minimum and maximum bets that apply.</p>
<p>The aim of roulette is to guess where the ball will land after spinning around the wheel. The wheel has 36 numbered slots plus zero and double zero slots. As the ball drops onto the wheel, it will eventually settle into one of these slots and your winning or losing bet will be revealed.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for an exciting and suspenseful game to play in an online casino, roulette should definitely be at the top of your list!</p>
<h1 id="Enjoy-Different-Types-of-Roulette-Games-at-online-casinos"><a href="#Enjoy-Different-Types-of-Roulette-Games-at-online-casinos" class="headerlink" title="Enjoy Different Types of Roulette Games at online casinos"></a>Enjoy Different Types of Roulette Games at online casinos</h1><p>The gambling world has many games, but one of the most popular is roulette. This game can be found in casinos all over the world and online. In fact, there are now different types of roulette games that players can enjoy.</p>
<p>One of the most common versions of roulette is American roulette. This game has a wheel with 38 slots, numbered 1 to 36, and zero and double zero. Bets can be placed on a range of numbers, colors, or combinations. Players also have the option to bet on whether the ball will land on a black or red number, or whether it will be odd or even.</p>
<p>European roulette is similar to American roulette but has one less slot on the wheel. This means that the odds of winning are slightly higher in European roulette than in American roulette.</p>
<p>French roulette is another popular version of this game. In French roulette, players can bet on specific numbers or groups of numbers. There is also a special bet known as “la partage” which gives players half their bet back if the ball lands on zero.</p>
<p>Finally, there is mini-roulette which is a smaller version of the game that is ideal for beginners or those who want to play for shorter periods of time. Mini-roulette has just 13 slots on the wheel and offers simpler betting options than other versions of this game.</p>

<h1 id="How-Does-Roulette-Work-at-Shakespeare-Casino"><a href="#How-Does-Roulette-Work-at-Shakespeare-Casino" class="headerlink" title="How Does Roulette Work at Shakespeare Casino?"></a>How Does Roulette Work at Shakespeare Casino?</h1><p>Roulette is one of the most popular casino games and at Shakespeare Casino, it’s one of the easiest games to understand and play. In this article, we’re going to take a look at how roulette works, what different bets you can place and how to win at roulette.</p>
<h2 id="The-Basics-of-Roulette"><a href="#The-Basics-of-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="The Basics of Roulette"></a>The Basics of Roulette</h2><p>Roulette is a type of casino game where players bet on where a ball will land after spinning around a wheel. There are different types of bets that you can make in roulette, including betting on a single number, betting on a range of numbers or betting on whether the ball will land in black or red.</p>
<p>The aim of the game is to correctly predict where the ball will end up after the spin. If you guess correctly, you’ll win your bet amount multiplied by the odds for that bet. For example, if you bet on a single number and the ball lands on that number, you’ll win 36 times your original bet amount. However, if you guess incorrectly, you’ll lose your bet amount.</p>
<p>At Shakespeare Casino, we offer both American and European versions of roulette. The difference between the two versions is that American roulette has two zeroes (0 and 00), while European roulette only has one zero (0). This makes European roulette more favourable to players as there is a higher chance of winning when betting on single numbers.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Play-Roulette"><a href="#How-to-Play-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="How to Play Roulette"></a>How to Play Roulette</h2><p>To play roulette, first choose how much money you want to wager on each spin. You can then place your bets by clicking on the relevant boxes on the table layout. When you’re ready, click ‘Spin’ to start the game. The dealer then spins the wheel and releases the ball, which begins its journey around the wheel before finally landing in one of the numbered slots. If you’ve placed a winning bet, your payout is automatically calculated and paid out to you. If you’ve lost any bets during the spin, they are automatically collected from your account balance.</p>
<p>There are different ways that you can place bets in roulette - we’ll take a look at some of them below:</p>
